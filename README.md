# pwa-starter-flask
PWA framework built on Python3 and Flask.  Great place to start building a mobile PWA.

- Just pull this repo down, install python requirements.txt, and execute app.py.  Assuming this works cleanly, you can start to build something magical.  More details on install coming.

- Easy to push to Heroku so you can easily share. (these details also coming)
