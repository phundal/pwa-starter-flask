# pwa-starter-flask
PWA framework built on Python3 and Flask.  Great place to start building a mobile PWA.

Just pull this darling down, install python requirements.txt, and execute app.py.  More details on install coming.

Easy to push to Heroku so you can easily share. (these details also coming)
